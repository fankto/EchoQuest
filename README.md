## Prerequisites
Before installing EchoQuest, ensure you have the following:

* Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system
* A GPU with at least 10GB VRAM
* At least 15GB of free disk space
* A Hugging Face account with access to the following models:
    * `meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct`: Used for question extraction and answering
    * `openai/whisper-large-v3-turbo`: Used for audio transcription
    * `pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1`: Used for speaker diarization

You need to request access to these models on the Hugging Face website and obtain an API token.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/fankto/EchoQuest.git
   cd EchoQuest
   ```

2. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with the following content:
   ```
   HF_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token_here
   ```
   Replace `your_huggingface_token_here` with your actual Hugging Face API token.

3. Start the application:
* For first-time setup:
  ```
  docker-compose up --build
  ```
  This will build the Docker images and start the containers.

* For subsequent starts:
  ```
  docker-compose up
  ```
  This will start the existing containers.

* To stop the application:
  ```
  docker-compose down
  ```

4. Once the containers are running, you can access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.
